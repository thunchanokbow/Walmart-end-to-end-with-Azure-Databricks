# Walmart-end-to-end-with-Azure-Databricks
This project integrates data from websites using Azure Data Factory. The data is extracted in batches and transformed using Spark in Azure Databricks. The transformed data is stored in Synapse Analytics in columnar format. Finally, a dashboard is created using Looker Studio or Power BI, As a result of my project, juice has become their top-selling category! This will help with the decision to promote juices by placing them in more visible locations. Their most popular juice is Welch's Fruit Punch, which sells about 48 packs per day, with each pack containing 6 bottles. With this information, Walmart can contact Welch's to order more juice and discuss pricing options.
